            <li>Onions (finely sliced) - 2 large</li>
            <li>Garlic (minced) - 4 cloves</li>
            <li>Ginger (minced) - 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>Tomatoes (chopped) - 2 medium</li>
            <li>Potatoes (peeled and quartered) - 2 medium (optional)</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil - 3 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Pilau Masala - 2 tablespoons (can be homemade or store-bought, includes cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and black pepper)</li>
            <li>Cumin Seeds - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Cinnamon Stick - 1 piece</li>
            <li>Bay Leaves - 2</li>
            <li>Cloves - 4-5</li>
            <li>Green Cardamom Pods - 3-4</li>
            <li>Black Peppercorns - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Salt - to taste</li>
            <li>Beef or Chicken Broth - 4 cups (or water)</li>
            <li>Fresh Coriander Leaves (for garnish) - a handful</li>
            <li>Green Chilies (optional, for added heat) - 1-2, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the goat meat with a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of pilau masala. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the spices to penetrate the meat.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the marinated goat meat and brown it on all sides. Once browned, remove the meat from the pot and set it aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot, add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, cloves, green cardamom pods, and black peppercorns. Sauté the spices until they become fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the finely sliced onions to the pot and sauté until they turn golden brown. This step is crucial for developing the deep, rich color and flavor of the pilau.</li>
            <li>Stir in the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute. Then, add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and blend with the onions, creating a thick sauce.</li>
            <li>Return the browned goat meat to the pot and mix it with the spice and onion mixture. Add the remaining pilau masala and cook for a few minutes, allowing the meat to absorb the flavors.</li>
            <li>If using potatoes, add them to the pot and stir well.</li>
            <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and add it to the pot, stirring to coat the rice with the spices and meat. Let the rice cook for a few minutes, allowing it to absorb the flavors.</li>
            <li>Pour in the beef or chicken broth (or water) and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Once the pilau is cooked, turn off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
            <li>Serve the goat pilau hot, with sides like kachumbari or a tangy yogurt sauce for a complete meal.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your flavorful East African Pilau</p>
