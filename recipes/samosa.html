    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef samosas are a popular East African snack, known for their crispy exterior and flavorful filling. 
            These triangular pastries are filled with spiced ground beef, onions, and herbs, creating a delicious blend of textures and tastes. 
            Samosas are commonly enjoyed as an appetizer or snack and are often served with a side of chutney or hot sauce.</p>
        <p>In East Africa, beef samosas are a favorite during special occasions, tea time, and street food culture. 
            The filling is encased in a thin pastry dough, which is then folded into the signature triangular shape and deep-fried to golden perfection. 
            The result is a savory treat that is both crunchy and satisfying.</p>
