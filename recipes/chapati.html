    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chapati is a staple flatbread in East African cuisine, particularly in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. 
            This versatile bread is made from simple ingredients—flour, water, and salt—yet it's cherished for its soft texture and delightful flavor. 
            Chapati is often served alongside stews, curries, or vegetables, and it’s perfect for scooping up savory dishes.</p>
        <p>In East Africa, chapati is not only a daily food but also a symbol of warmth and hospitality. 
            It is often made in large batches for family gatherings, celebrations, and communal meals. 
            The dough is kneaded until soft, rolled out thin, and cooked on a hot griddle until golden brown, resulting in a beautifully layered flatbread that is both crispy and soft.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All-Purpose Flour - 3 cups</li>
            <li>Water - 1 to 1.5 cups (as needed)</li>
            <li>Salt - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil or Ghee - 3 tablespoons (plus extra for cooking)</li>
        </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee and mix well.</li>
            <li>Gradually add water while kneading the dough until it becomes soft and pliable. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into equal-sized balls. Roll each ball into a thin, round shape on a floured surface.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle or flat pan over medium heat. Place the rolled-out dough on the hot griddle.</li>
            <li>Cook the chapati on one side until it starts to puff up and brown spots appear. Flip and cook the other side, brushing with oil or ghee.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining dough balls. Stack the cooked chapatis in a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm and soft.</li>
            <li>Serve the chapatis hot, alongside your favorite stew, curry, or vegetable dish.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your delicious homemade Chapati!</p>
